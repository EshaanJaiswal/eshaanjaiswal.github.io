Hello! I'm **Eshaan**, a **Computer Science and Engineering** student at [**IIT Gandhinagar**](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/) (Class of 2028). I'm driven to translate complex theory into robust, functional code. My current technical focus is on exploring **AI/ML/DL**, **Computer Vision and Deep Learning**, **Algorithmic Research**, **Game Theory**, and **Competitive Coding**. I view engineering as a dynamic platform for continuous learning and innovation.

I balance analytical work with strong creative pursuits. I am a musician, proficient in **Fingerstyle Guitar, Keys, and Bass**, which sharpens my ability to recognize patterns and structure. I also pursue **wildlife photography**, a hobby requiring the precision and patience that benefit my engineering work. You can see my captures on [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/eshaan_does_creative_stuff/).

I am committed to contributing to the engineering community with rigor and ingenuity. You can explore my projects on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/EshaanJaiswal) and connect with me via [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eshaanjaiswal/) for professional inquiries. I also appreciate the industry's lighter side in communities like [**r/ProgrammerHumor**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/).
